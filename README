###- QUICK AND DIRTY: COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION -############################
  You'll need scons and pkg-config. No ifs or buts.

    $ scons install
    $ scons hosted=yes install


################################################################################


NOTE:
  This is version two of this library; It has been tested with the included
  test-suite on a number of systems of differing architectures as well as
  different operating systems. However, there hasn't been any large-scale field
  testing just yet, nor has there been any extensive code review.

  Also, library documentation is still scarce, that's planned for v3 or v4.

NOTE.2:
  Please take note of the library licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
  credits (the CREDITS file).


###- DETAILS -##################################################################

Compilation:
  Make sure you have scons installed, then:

    $ scons library

  This will compile the library itself; if you also want test cases and the
  helper programme, use this:

    $ scons

  A number of compilation options are available if you run into issues. To see
  them, use:

    $ scons --help

Installation:
  use this command to install regularly (usually into /usr):

    $ scons install

  To add an installation-only prefix, use:

    $ scons destdir=/some/prefix install

Compiling/Installing special 'hosted' Versions:
  If you intend to use libcurie with the host libc, you should also do the
  following to install special host-libc versions:

    $ scons hosted=yes library
    $ scons hosted=yes install

  You should do this AFTER you've compiled and installed the non-hosted variant.
  Alternatively, just the install-command alone would do too.

Linking against libcurie:
  Use pkg-config to retrieve the flags needed to link with libcurie:

    $ pkg-config --cflags --libs libcurie

  For the hosted variant, use:

    $ pkg-config --cflags --libs libcurie-hosted

  Check pkg-config's documentation for more details.

Testing:
  Please help by giving this library's test suite a shot:

    $ scons
    $ ./run-tests

  When running this suite, please take note of the memory use with a tool like
  top. Afterwards, just send the output of the ./run-tests command to
  <magnus.deininger@student.uni-tuebingen.de>, or drop by on IRC

  Best bet is IRC: freenode #kyuba
