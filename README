NOTE:
  This is version one of this library; It has been tested with the included
  test-suite on a number of systems of differing architectures as well as
  different operating systems. However, there hasn't been any large-scale field
  testing just yet, nor has there been any extensive code review.

  Also, library documentation is still scarce, that's planned for v2 or v3.

NOTE.2:
  Please take note of the library licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
  credits (the CREDITS file).

Compilation:
  Make sure you have scons installed, then:

    $ scons library

  This will compile the library itself; if you also want test cases and the
  helper programme, use this:

    $ scons

  A number of compilation options are available if you run into issues. To see
  them, use:

    $ scons --help

Installation:
  use this command to install regularly (usually into /usr):

    $ scons install

  To add an installation-only prefix, use:

    $ scons destdir=/some/prefix install

Testing:
  Please help by giving this library's test suite a shot:

    $ scons
    $ ./run-tests

  When running this suite, please take note of the memory use with a tool like
  top. Afterwards, just send the output of the ./run-tests command to
  <magnus.deininger@student.uni-tuebingen.de>, or drop by on IRC
