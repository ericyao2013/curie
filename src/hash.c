/* see comment above for hash_murmur2_64()
   note that this is a copy of the "corresponding" hash function, because the
   murmurhash2 is pretty small to begin with, so small that the overhead of
   indirecting the function call would probably be worse than just copying
   the function. of course modern compilers are supposed to inline... but meh,
   it's not that big of a deal anyway. */
