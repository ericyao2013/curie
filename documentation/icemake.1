.TH ICEMAKE 1 "APRIL 2009" Curie "Curie Developers Manual"

.SH NAME
icemake \- curie build and installation tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B icemake -h|--help

.BI "icemake [-cDfiLorRsSx] [-t " chost "] [-z " version "]"
.BI "[-d " destdir "] [-b " name "] [-l "
.IB libdir "] [-j " num "] [" targets "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B icemake
is used to build programmes, libraries and documentation for curie and non-curie
programmes. The configuration file for icemake does not allow for much
flexibility in the layout of the source directory, which may be seen as a
disadvantage or an advantage, depending on your point of view. Either way it
does make sure that all repositories using icemake have a similar structure and
it should thus make browsing sources easier.

.SH OPTIONS
Note that the options may be concatenated in a slightly unusual manner:
parameters that require an argument will always use the "next free" argument,
quite similar to the
.BR tar (1)
utility. This may seem unusual when compared to other programmes. If you find it
confusing, simply always separate arguments with parameters from arguments
without.

.IP "-h, --help"
Print a short summary of the options, then exit.

.IP "-c"
Use GCCs
.B --combine
option for C source file compilation. This may improve certain optimisations.

.IP "-D"
Use debug code files (which need to be in an appriate debug/ directory) instead
of the normal code files, when available.

.IP "-f"
When installing, use the FHS layout, or at least the subtype encountered under
/usr.

.IP "-i"
After compilation and testing, install the generated programmes, libraries,
documentation and auxiliary files, along with appropriate bundled data and
documentation files.

.IP "-L"
Pass special optimisation flags to the linker. This is similar to running the
.BR strip (1)
utility on generated programmes, however the resulting link may be even smaller
as the linker may have more data available to it.

.IP "-o"
Do not link dynamic libraries. This simply disables linking of .so files and
generation of the .pic.o files. It does not necessarily influence linking
against shared objects already present on the target system.

.IP "-r"
Execute library runtime tests. This option will build and execute runtime tests
for libraries specified in the icemake.sx file.

.IP "-R"
Enforce a dynamic link, as opposed to the (default) static link.

.IP "-s"
Use the AFSL-style filesystem layout for installation. This is the default, even
though you may quite realistically want to instruct icemake to use the FHS
layout instead.

.IP "-S"
Enforce a static link; this is the default, as for curie programmes it usually
results in the smallest possible runtime memory use.

.IP "-x"
Build documentation, provided that the necessary tools are available.

.IP "-t chost"
Specify the target for the build. If unspecified, an appropriate target string
is built from the information obtained by
.BR uname (2)
, otherwise this string is used. This influences the search for appropriate
compiler binaries.

.IP "-z version"
Similar to the
.B -t
option, this specifies the version of the toolchain to use, if more than one is
installed and the toolchain binaries are suffixed with the version.

.IP "-d destdir"
Tell icemake where to install the resulting binaries to.

.IP "-b name"
Use a slightly modified FHS layout for installation: binaries end up in
.IB destdir / libdir / name /bin/
instead of the plain old
.IB destdir /bin/
which would be the default location.

.IP "-l libdir"
Specify the library directory to install to. This defaults to
.B lib
and it only makes sense to specify this with the FHS layout.

.IP "-j num"
Specify the number of programmes to run concurrently. This may greatly speed up
compilation times, but it may also introduce unusual issues, so by default only
one programme is launched concurrently. Installation is, however, always done
in parallel, that is, all files are being read from and written to at more or
less the same time.

.IP "targets"
This is a list of targets to build. Obviously only targets defined in icemake.sx
are allowed.

.SH FILES
.I icemake.sx
.RS
Build data file. See
.BR icemake.sx (5)
for further details.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the build process:

.IP CFLAGS
The flags in this variable are added to the command line of C compiler
invocations.

.IP CXXFLAGS
The flags in this variable are added to the command line of C++ compiler
invocations.

.IP LDFLAGS
The flags in this variable are added to the command line of linker invocations.
Note that for gcc, ld is not invoked directly but instead gcc is being invoked,
so that the LDFLAGS maybe need to use the
.B -Wl,
switch for exotic linker flags.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following issues are known:

.IP "EAGAIN, 'Resource not available', in programmes calling icemake"
This is especially prevalent with programmes like portage. Icemake puts its
stdout into non-blocking mode, and poorly designed programmes that do not expect
to receive an EAGAIN message while trying to read from icemake's stdout may
choke on this.

.SH BUGS
.I Build Process
.RS
icemake may be unable to link libraries and programmes in the right order, and
instead rely on the order in the icemake.sx file.

icemake will also fail to detect changed header files and will not re-build
programme and library files using these modified header files automatically. If
you modify header files, it may be best to completely erase the build/ directory
and to call icemake again.

icemake is currently limited to the gcc toolchain. Other toolchains require
additional code to be added to icemake.

Building for non-unixy systems will, at the very least, get filenames wrong and
will require the build.sh file to be rewritten as, for example, a windows
command/batch script, or it will require a manually built version of icemake, or
cross-compilation.

Linking C++ programmes may result in minor havoc, due to the weird linking
requirements for C++ programmes exposed by g++ and the utter lack of a proper
way to tell g++ that one wishes to build a freestanding programme. This also
results in icemake always linking C++ programmes against the host C library,
even if curie is properly standalone.

Cross-compilation may or may not work, but in general this tool should at least
be able to find the proper compiler binaries and use them, if the
.B -t
option is being used, and each target gets its own directory under build/*/.
.RE

.I Testing
.RS
icemake may try to link tests for libraries before having completely linked the
library they are supposed to test. This erratic behaviour is usually triggered
by the
.B -j
option.
.RE

.I Installation
.RS
icemake is currently unable to install the documentation generated by the
doxygen tool automatically, so you need to copy this data manually. This is in
part due to icemake not being able to parse the doxygen file and thus being
completely in the dark as to what documentation is being built and where it is
being put.
