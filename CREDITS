== SPONSORING ==
 * special thanks to Codex (http://www.codex.gr/) for providing sponsoring, as
   well as certain pieces of code and help with algorithmical issues.

== VALGRIND ==
 * files "src/linux/*-valgrind.c" ONLY:
   - these files have special extra code to instruct the excellent memory debug
     suite 'valgrind' on how to detect bad pointer access, since we're not using
     the standard malloc/free allocation scheme.
     this code is /only/ used if you use the -a option for icemake to make it
     use those files.

== HASH ALGORITHMS ==
 * In various places, this library makes use of the MurmurHash2 functions and
   derivatives by Austin Appleby.
   These functions /appear/ to be either in the public domain, but it still
   feels like a good idea to credit the author. To get to the original
   functions, see:
     * http://murmurhash.googlepages.com/ (MurmurHash2)
