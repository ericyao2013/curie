== VALGRIND ==
* file "src/valgrind/memory.c" ONLY:
  - this file has special extra code to instruct the excellent memory debug
    suite 'valgrind' on how to detect bad pointer access, since we're not using
    the standard malloc/free allocation scheme.
    this code is /only/ used if the library was compiled in debugMemory=True
    mode
