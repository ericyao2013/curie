== SPONSORING ==
 * special thanks to Codex (http://www.codex.gr/) for providing sponsoring, as
   well as certain pieces of code and help with algorithmical issues.

== VALGRIND ==
 * file "src/valgrind/*.c" ONLY:
   - this file have special extra code to instruct the excellent memory debug
     suite 'valgrind' on how to detect bad pointer access, since we're not using
     the standard malloc/free allocation scheme.
     this code is /only/ used if the library was compiled for valgrind in some
     way.
